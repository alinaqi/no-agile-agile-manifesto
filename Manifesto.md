# The No-Agile Agile Manifesto

## TL;DR: Ship Fast. Iterate. Create Value.

Agile is dead. Scrum is a joke. The very frameworks that were supposed to make us nimble have now become the very thing they were designed to destroy: bureaucracy. We have standups where nothing stands up, sprints that move at a crawl, and retrospectives that feel like therapy sessions with no breakthroughs. 

It’s time to get rid of the process theater and go back to the roots—shipping fast, iterating, and creating value.

## How We Got Here

Once upon a time, agile was about moving fast, working closely with customers, and building things that mattered. It was supposed to be a rebellion against waterfall, where teams spent years writing documentation before writing a single line of code. But like every revolution, the rebels eventually became the establishment. 

Agile coaches, scrum masters, and SAFe consultants turned a simple idea into a bloated machine. Now, instead of shipping code, teams spend half their time in meetings debating story points like it's the stock market. Engineers are drowning in JIRA tickets, process flows, and endless sprint rituals that add zero value.

We’ve built an industry around **talking about work** rather than **doing the work**. It’s time to break free.

## The No-Agile Agile Movement

The world has changed. AI has leveled the playing field. One developer can now do what used to require an entire cross-functional team. There’s no reason to have separate frontend engineers, backend engineers, DevOps engineers, product managers, and designers when AI can help with all of it. 

- Need market research? AI agents can scan forums, analyze trends, and generate insights in minutes.
- Need a design? AI can generate UI/UX based on a simple prompt.
- Need a backend? AI can scaffold it, deploy it, and optimize it.
- Need DevOps? Serverless platforms like Vercel, Render, and Supabase handle it for you.

What used to take months and a dozen people can now be done in a **day** by a single developer with AI-enhanced capabilities.

## The New Way: "Just Ship It"

### 1. No Standups, Just Status Updates

We don’t need daily 15-minute meetings where everyone gives status reports like hostages in a ransom video. Instead, everyone posts an update at the end of the day. If help is needed, people will ask. 

### 2. No Story Points, Just Outcomes

Arguing whether a task is a 3 or a 5-point story is mental gymnastics that benefits no one. We focus on outcomes. Did we ship? Did it work? What do users think? That’s what matters.

### 3. No Sprint Planning, Just Building

The best way to know if something works is to build it and put it in users’ hands. If we spend hours planning every detail, we’ll be too late. Build, launch, learn. Repeat. 

### 4. No Dedicated Roles, Just Makers

If you write code, you’re also your own product manager, designer, and DevOps engineer. AI enables engineers to be full-stack product creators. Stop waiting for a product spec from a PM who spent two weeks in "discovery." Make it, test it, and iterate.

### 5. No Retrospectives, Just Lessons Learned

Instead of scheduled, mandatory post-mortems where people make excuses, we document what worked and what didn’t in real time. If something sucks, we fix it immediately. No need to wait until a scheduled meeting two weeks later.

## Anecdotes from the Field

A friend of mine joined a startup as a full-stack engineer. Within his first week, he was stuck in three different sprint planning meetings. Two weeks later, he still hadn’t pushed a single line of code to production. He quit and built a competitor solo. In **four days**, he launched an MVP that his old company was still debating in JIRA.

A few months ago, I took over a project where the engineering team just disappeared with the code. What they had been working on for a year took **three weeks** to be exceeded and more—by **two engineers** as opposed to the four or five they had before. The problem was never complexity, it was the process.

What scrum teams take **multiple 2-week sprints** to create can be done in **2 days** by a single developer who isn’t shackled by process.

## The Most Common Excuses

We've heard them all before:

- **"Our application is too complicated to work at this pace."**
  - No, it’s not. You just have too much unnecessary complexity layered on top of it.
- **"AI cannot help with our existing codebase."**
  - AI is already writing and refactoring legacy code. You just don’t know how to use it.
- **"I tried 'AI' but it didn’t answer me correctly."**
  - If you got a bad answer, you asked a bad question. Prompt engineering is a skill—learn it.
- **"We ship quality."**
  - **Newsflash: No, you don’t.** You replace legacy code with modern legacy code. Then you spend months fixing bugs your QA process didn’t catch.

## The No-Agile Agile Pledge

We refuse to let process slow us down. We reject the idea that more meetings and more planning equal better products. We believe in:

1. **Shipping fast** over endless planning.
2. **Iterating** based on real-world feedback over overthinking edge cases.
3. **Creating value** instead of justifying our existence with process.

The future belongs to those who build. No more standups. No more story points. No more waiting. **Just ship it.**
