# No-Agile Agile Manifesto

## 🚀 Overview
Agile is dead. Scrum is bloated. What was meant to make teams nimble has turned into a bureaucratic nightmare. The No-Agile Agile Manifesto is a call to return to what really matters: **shipping fast, iterating, and creating value**—without the process theater.

## 📖 What’s Inside?
- Why Agile has become the very bureaucracy it was meant to replace
- How AI enables developers to build and deploy independently
- The new way: No standups, no sprints, just results
- Real-world anecdotes on how lean teams outperform traditional Agile teams
- Common excuses that hold teams back—and why they’re wrong

## 🔥 The Core Principles
1. **No standups, just status updates** – Save time, focus on execution.
2. **No story points, just outcomes** – Deliver real value, not arbitrary estimates.
3. **No sprint planning, just building** – Learn by doing, not by debating.
4. **No dedicated roles, just makers** – Engineers can do it all with AI.
5. **No retrospectives, just lessons learned** – Fix problems immediately.
